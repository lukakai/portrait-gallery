# Portrait Gallery Skill

This repository can be installed directly as an AI-agent skill. Once installed,
the agent should use these instructions to set up and operate the local Portrait
Gallery service.

## Install In An AI Agent

### Codex

Ask Codex to install the skill from GitHub:

```text
Use $skill-installer to install https://github.com/OWNER/REPO as a skill.
Use repo OWNER/REPO, path ., and name portrait-gallery.
```

If running the installer script manually:

```bash
python ~/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --path . \
  --name portrait-gallery
```

Restart the agent after installation so it can discover the new skill.

### Other Skill-Capable Agents

Install this repository URL as a skill source:

```text
https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
```

If the agent asks for a skill path, use `.`. If it asks for a skill name, use
`portrait-gallery`.

### Hermes Agent / OpenClaw

Both [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) and OpenClaw support
skill-based integration. After installing this repo as a skill:

1. **Load the skill** — the agent loads `SKILL.md` automatically when the user
   mentions the gallery, or load it explicitly (e.g. `skill_view(name='portrait-gallery')`).
2. **Operate via REST API** — the agent drives the running gallery through the
   REST endpoints documented below (generate, schedule, favorite, delete).
3. **Image generation routing** — point the gallery at your agent's existing
   model gateway. If you run [AxonHub](https://github.com/looplj/AxonHub) (used by
   many Hermes setups), set `GPT_IMAGE_BASE_URL` to your AxonHub `/v1` endpoint
   and `GPT_IMAGE_API_KEY` to an AxonHub key — the gallery sends OpenAI-compatible
   image requests and AxonHub handles multi-channel fallback.
4. **Push delivery** — generated photos can be pushed to your agent's messaging
   channel (the reference setup uses `hermes send --to weixin`; adapt the
   delivery hook to your own platform).

## What This Skill Does

Portrait Gallery is a local AI outfit portrait system:

- Generates a daily outfit plan and HH:mm schedule with an LLM.
- Dynamically schedules image-generation jobs from the generated schedule.
- Generates portraits with OpenAI-compatible image APIs (GPT Image / AxonHub / custom endpoints), Gemini, and optional Gitee z-image-turbo fallback.
- Manages multiple local/runtime characters for single portraits, reference sheets, and group photos.
- Provides a group-chat workspace with persistent rooms, participant bindings, LLM-backed character replies, and optional image tool calls.
- Uses a multi-model LLM chain (`llm.models`) for schedule generation, captions, group chat, and fallback inference.
- Extracts a keyword cloud from user prompts and favorite wardrobe items, then uses it as a soft daily schedule reference.
- Injects real date context for weekends, public holidays, make-up workdays, and configured calendar overrides.
- Serves a local Web gallery for today/all/favorites/custom generation.
- Stores runtime data in `data/schedule_data.json` and images in `data/images/`.
- Exposes a REST API for agents and integrations.

## Agent Workflow

### 1. Locate Or Prepare The Project

If the user already has a checkout, work there. Otherwise clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
cd portrait-gallery
```

Before editing, inspect the worktree:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

Never overwrite user changes unless the user explicitly asks.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Direct Python run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

Docker run:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Published image run:

```bash
PORTRAIT_GALLERY_IMAGE=REGISTRY_OR_USER/hermes-portrait-gallery:1.3.2 docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Configure Keys

Prefer the Web UI settings panel when the service is running:

```text
http://localhost:18889
```

Or configure environment variables:

```bash
export CPA_API_KEY="your-cpa-api-key"
export CPA_BASE_URL="http://your-cpa-proxy:port/v1"
export GPT_IMAGE_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # AxonHub: ah-xxxxx, Direct: sk-xxxxx
export GPT_IMAGE_BASE_URL="http://your-endpoint/v1"  # AxonHub or OpenAI-compatible
export GALLERY_API_KEY="optional-web-api-key"
```

**Recommended Setup**: Route through [AxonHub](https://github.com/looplj/AxonHub) for multi-channel fallback and unified management:

```bash
export GPT_IMAGE_BASE_URL="http://your-axonhub-host:port/v1"
export GPT_IMAGE_API_KEY="ah-xxxxx"  # Your AxonHub API key
```

**Configuration Priority** (high to low):
1. Environment variables (`CPA_API_KEY`, `GPT_IMAGE_API_KEY`, etc.)
2. Web UI Settings Panel (saved to `data/api_keys_config.json`)
3. `config/config.yaml` (default values)

Runtime key files are stored under `data/`; avoid printing secrets in user
responses.

### 4. Start The Service

Direct run:

```bash
cd app
python3 -m main
```

The default Web UI is:

```text
http://localhost:18889
```

If a service is already listening on port `18889`, inspect it before starting a
new process:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:18889 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

### 5. Verify Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:18889/api/health
curl http://localhost:18889/api/today
curl http://localhost:18889/api/schedule-detail
curl http://localhost:18889/api/photo-jobs
```

If `GALLERY_API_KEY` is set, pass it as `X-API-Key` or `?key=...`.

## Common Agent Tasks

### Refresh Today's Schedule

Regenerate the LLM schedule without immediately generating an image:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/refresh-schedule
```

This should rewrite today's date-keyed schedule entry and rebuild future dynamic
photo jobs.

### Generate A Photo For The Current Period

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/generate-now \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

The server chooses the theme from the current local time.

### Generate A Custom Prompt

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/generate-custom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"wearing a white dress under cherry blossoms","size":"1024x1536"}'
```

### Manage Gallery Images

```bash
curl http://localhost:18889/api/gallery
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/images/<image_filename>/favorite
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:18889/api/images/<image_filename>
```

### Manage Characters

```bash
curl http://localhost:18889/api/characters
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/characters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Mika","persona":"warm, curious, lively","appearance":"natural realistic portrait subject"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/characters/<character_id>/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"walking through a quiet bookstore","shot_type":"half_body"}'
```

### Use Group Chat

```bash
curl http://localhost:18889/api/group-chat/rooms
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/group-chat/rooms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Daily room","participants":[{"character_id":"default"}]}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/group-chat/rooms/<room_id>/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"今天想拍一张书店合照","sender":{"type":"user","display_name":"user"}}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:18889/api/group-chat/rooms/<room_id>/reply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## Debugging Notes

- Python changes require a service restart.
- Frontend changes in `app/web/index.html` only need a browser refresh.
- Dynamic photo jobs are in-memory APScheduler jobs; after restart, the app
  should restore future jobs from today's saved schedule.
- If the schedule looks too short, check `data/schedule_data.json` for a complete
  date-keyed entry such as `"2026-06-05"` with non-empty `schedule`, `outfit`,
  `prompt`, and `caption`.
- If images generate but no schedule appears, inspect `schedule_time` fields on
  image entries and the `/api/schedule-detail` fallback logic.
- Use `python3 -m py_compile` on edited Python files before restarting.

## Safety Notes For Agents

- Treat API keys and `data/api_keys_config.json` as secrets.
- Confirm before deleting images, changing keys, or running self-update actions.
- Avoid exposing the service publicly unless `GALLERY_API_KEY` is set.
- Do not run multiple long image-generation processes unless the user asks.
